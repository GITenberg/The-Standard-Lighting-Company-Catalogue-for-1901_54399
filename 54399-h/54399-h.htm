  <h2 class='c003'>TO THE TRADE.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c004'>In presenting this catalogue to the trade, we beg to call attention to
the completeness in detail of the various lines herein represented,
embracing the largest variety of the latest improved cooking
devices which inventive genius and manufacturer’s skill have, as yet,
been able to produce.</p>

<p class='c005'>We take just pride in the efficiency already attained in the construction
and the general advancement of the Gasoline and Oil Stove
business, of which we have been largely the originators.</p>

<p class='c005'>A glance at the pages following will disclose the fact that we have
been thoroughly alive to the best interests of our line, showing more
new goods and greater improvements than we have ever before been
able to offer in a single season.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our leaders, the “NEW PROCESS” Gasoline Stoves, and the
“STANDARD” WICKLESS BLUE FLAME Oil Stoves, together
with an almost endless variety of medium and low-priced stoves, will
enable Jobbers and Dealers who are identified with our line, to supply
every possible demand for this class of goods.</p>

<p class='c005'>We hope by enterprise in keeping our different lines of goods in
the highest possible state of perfection, and by a strict adherence to
the principle of right in our dealings, to merit a continuance of the
liberal patronage which has been accorded us in the past.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>It is with the feeling of great assurance and satisfaction that we offer to the trade our “<b>New
Process</b>” Vapor Stove, shown on pages following. It is the <b>Original Evaporating Stove</b> that
has revolutionized the Gasoline Stove business.</p>

<p class='c005'>For more than a decade it has demonstrated its superiority over every other stove, in <b>Safety,
Simplicity and Economy</b> of operation, and has won for itself a place in the hearts and homes of
many thousands of housewives, whose burdens have been made lighter and lives happier by its use.</p>

<p class='c005'>It lights like gas! A feature that makes it popular, as without heat, smoke or delay, the stove
can be instantly started in operation; turn the valve wheel and apply the match; the stove is ready for
work. Could anything be more simple? No carrying in coal or wood; no smoke, soot or dirt; no ashes
to carry out; the ceilings of the kitchens are not covered with black smoke and soot where the “<b>New
Process</b>” Gasoline Stove is used.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tank, or gasoline reservoir, is not connected to the stove and can be easily lifted from it and
carried to an outer room for filling or cleaning, thus insuring safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>In operation, the fluid drips drop by drop (never runs) on the perforated brass evaporator, where
it is divided into fine particles, which, passing through the air, evaporate; the gas thus made being
heavier than air, passes down through the evaporator tubes, mixing with and carburetting a current of
air, which is lighted at the burner, producing a smokeless blue flame of great intensity and heating
power.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it will be seen that the “<b>New Process</b>” is a veritable gas machine and a gas stove combined,
entirely under the control of the user, who can increase or decrease the supply of fuel at will, securing
the requisite amount of heat without waste; starting or stopping the fire according to requirement,
thereby securing the greatest possible convenience, safety and economy of operation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “<b>New Process</b>” solves the problem of economical cooking in all country homes and suburban
residences where gas for fuel cannot be obtained, giving to the user every advantage, convenience
and comfort which the use of gas stoves and other modern appliances afford.</p>

<p class='c005'>The general construction of all our stoves is thoroughly first-class. The design is new, attractive
and well planned for convenience. The frames of all “<b>New Process</b>” Stoves are made in cabinet style
and are strong and rigid. The tops are of ample width and provided with removable grates; the burner
drums are of polished brass. The burner caps <b>are removable</b>. The sub-fire device is removable with
the burner cap for inspection and cleaning, a point of great advantage. The stove is provided with a sight
feed, so that the dropping of the gasoline can at all times be seen when the stove is in operation. The
valves are provided with needles, having non-corrosive points; the tank is provided with a float which automatically
equalizes and regulates the flow of gasoline at all times, consequently the tank works as well
with a small amount of gasoline in it as it does when full. Parts exposed to the fire are cast iron and imperishable.
All parts are so constructed that they can easily be cleaned; the stoves are handsomely enameled
and ornamented. All stoves are carefully tested before shipping.</p>

<p class='c005'>Improvement is the “watch word” of the age, and the “<b>New Process</b>” will not be found in the
rear guard, in the “onward march to the goal of perfection.” Early in its history its unqualified efficiency
and success were demonstrated and it sprang at once into popular favor, where it still remains in advance
of every competitor.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “<b>New Process</b>” Vapor Stove is the original evaporating stove; it offers valuable features
that are not to be found in any other gasoline stove. With the new features and improvements for <b>1901</b>,
it is farther in the lead than ever before.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>READ CAREFULLY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>As our patterns are changed from year to year, it is absolutely necessary that we
know <b>the year the stove was made</b> for which you want repairs, and whether it is a
No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. The stoves are constructed of parts made detachable and interchangeable,
and in ordering repairs <b>be particular</b> to specify, <b>by number only</b>, just
which parts are required. It will not be necessary to order a drum (10) and heat collector
(11) where <b>only</b> the former is needed. See cut above.</p>

<p class='c005'>As you face the stove, the parts are “right” and “left.” Valves are “right,” “left”
and “center.” As valves have been changed from year to year, be particular in ordering
valves for old tanks, to specify whether valves are soldered on feed pipe or fastened with a
loose nut or union, or screwed into a solid nipple. Top brackets for 1893, 1894 and 1895
stoves are “right” and “left,” also the arms for weights. Step braces are “front” and
“back.” If drip and hot air tubes are wanted, say whether for “right,” “left,” “center”
or “oven” burners, and give the number of stove.</p>

<p class='c005'>The 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899 and 1900 ovens are made of sections.
New parts can be furnished, which anyone can put in place in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c004'>This stove is something entirely new and
unique. It is a gas machine, a cook stove and
an incandescent lamp combined.</p>

<p class='c005'>The stove is constructed with a powerful
generator which is located near the front of
the stove and is independent of all the burners.
This generator can be started quickly, without
smoke, and can be operated at a nominal
cost, furnishing gas for all the burners and the
light. The light can be used at any time and
independent of the burners by simply starting
the generator. The burners are large, with
removable sawed caps that spread the heat
evenly over the bottom of the cooking vessel.
After the generator has been heated there is
no further delay in lighting any of the burners. The “Standard” Ther-Lite is very
simple and easy to operate. It is a safe, efficient and economical cook stove and, with
the additional feature of incandescent illumination, is the most practical and useful gasoline
stove ever made. The stove can be ordered either with or without the light. The light
attachment can be put on or removed at any time.</p>

<p>Cut shows “Standard” Giant Burner With Smokeless Lighter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The “Standard” Giant Burner for 1901 is
a gasoline stove that can be fully recommended.
The burners are individual generators that
operate without a sub-fire. The burner cap is
not bolted to the burner and is easily removed
for cleaning. The burner head is large and
made of brass. It has a large generating surface
and is constructed with a lip of brass
extending from the top of the head up above
the burner cap and into the flame. This
makes it a very powerful generator which will
maintain a constant, steady flame even when
a heavy grade of gasoline is used. The large
upper needle controls the flow of gas to the burner and should never be used until after the
burner has been heated and ready for lighting. The lower small needle should never be
used except for turning on the gasoline in the starting cup. In starting the burner it is not
necessary to wait for all the gasoline to burn out of the cup. About two minutes after the
starting cup has been lighted turn on the main needle and the burner is ready for cooking.
The small upright needle located at the bottom of the large center tube is the cleaning
needle and is only to be used for cleaning the orifice or opening that regulates the flow of
gas to the burner. When a heavy grade of gasoline is used this orifice is liable to become
clogged. To avoid this the cleaning needle should be turned up every few days and the
orifice kept clean. The “Standard” Giant Burner stove lights quickly and maintains a
large flame which spreads evenly over the bottom of the cooking vessel. The stove is
simple in construction, perfect in operation, handsome in appearance and is recommended
as a good medium priced gasoline stove.</p>

<p class='c004'>To those who desire an old style individual
generator gasoline stove, we recommend the Globe
Junior, which is made on both high and low frames.
The burner head is made of brass and has a large
generating surface. The cap is of the drilled type.
The standpipe is made of brass and is packed in
such a manner as to give a steady flame. The large
upper needle controls the flow of gas to the burner.
The small upright needle is for cleaning only and
should be turned up every few days, until the point
shows at the orifice, and back again until the orifice
is clear, otherwise the opening is liable to become clogged from paraffine or other impurities
in the gasoline. Should the cleaning needle be hard to turn, a little lubricating oil or hard
soap should be used on the threads.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Globe Juniors are handsome in appearance; those with drop safety tanks are made
only on box frames; those with stationary tanks are made either on box or skeleton frames,
as ordered. Only the best workmanship and materials enter into the construction of our
Globe Juniors and they should not be compared with the many cheaply constructed Juniors
on the market.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing can bring greater comfort or pleasure to a sportsman than good, wholesome
food, well cooked and properly served!</p>

<p class='c005'>What’s so jolly as a meal on the yacht or in camp, after a day of sport and recreation?</p>

<p class='c005'>This stove provides a means for out-of-door cooking. The burners are enclosed to prevent
the flame from being blown out by the wind. The pressure of gas in the burners is
secured by a pneumatic bulb, a few pressures of which furnishes sufficient head for several
hours’ use. The tank is perfectly tight and prevents any possibility of spilling. In filling
the tank the pressure is released as soon as cap is removed, so that the flame is extinguished,
avoiding all danger in filling. Five gallons of ordinary stove gasoline will furnish fuel to
cook with for a party of six for ten days. The stove is furnished with side wall brackets
for the yacht and also with legs for camping. When used on brackets can be folded back
on wall and is sustained in that position with a hook, occupying very little space. As a
yacht stove, the four corner legs are not necessary, the back of stove being held by the
brackets; the front is sustained on a center leg by means of which stove can be readily
adjusted to any level required by position of boat. In shipping, the legs and tank are
packed in the stove.</p>

  <h2 id='wickless' class='c003'>The “Standard” Wickless Blue Flame.<br /><span class='large'>For Coal Oil and Gasoline.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It is with a feeling of great assurance and satisfaction that we offer our “Wickless” Blue Flame Oil Stove to the trade,
for this, its fourth season.</p>

<div  class='figleft id013'>
<img src='images/image036a.jpg' alt='image of stove parts' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 1.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>While there have been a number of other “Wickless” Stoves put on the market, the universal satisfaction with which
our “Standard” has been sold by the trade, and used by consumers, is the most positive evidence that it is properly constructed
to meet the popular demand for a good, practical, Oil Stove. The simplicity of our “Standard” Wickless, is a feature that
recommends it for use in the kitchen, where mechanical ingenuity is usually lacking.</p>

<p class='c005'>It cannot be styled an Evaporator or Generator, as it burns the oil as simply
and completely as a handfull of wood shavings would be burned, if ignited
in the fire pot of an ordinary cook stove. To successfully accomplish this
result, there are two important and vital features of the stove, and in which
ours differs from other styles of “Wickless,” namely: <b>the burner cup</b> that
receives and distributes the oil to the flame, and <b>the combustion chamber</b>
or <b>chimney</b> where the gases are mixed with air
in proper proportion, to produce a blue flame. (See
cut No. 1.)</p>

<div  class='figright id014'>
<img src='images/image036b.jpg' alt='image of stove parts' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 2.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The burner cup of the “Standard” Wickless, as
shown in cut No. 2, is made with an enlarged entrance,
the channel of the cup being divided so that the oil enters
on both sides of the cup, where it is conducted into
two channels, upper and lower, entirely around the cup.
In this manner the oil is distributed evenly to all parts
of the burner, giving a more even and perfect flame than
can be secured where there is only a single small
entrance to the cup. Further, our cup is less sensitive
to being out of level, on account of the manner in which
the oil is distributed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The enlarged opening at the entrance of the cup,
provides for the expansion of gas, which always takes
place where the oil enters a heated cup, thereby overcoming
the tendency toward a pulsating flame which
is a common and objectionable feature of all other
“Wickless” burner cups, constructed without an enlarged
opening at the entrance. By referring to Cut
No. 3, it will be seen that the channel cup is constructed
with a ledge, which projects from the outer rim toward the center of the cup, on this ledge the outside perforate of the chimney
rests. This ledge prevents, to a great degree, the oil from passing by capillary attraction, over the surfaces of the burner,
to that part which is outside of the chimney. For that reason the “Standard” Wickless can be operated with less smoke and
odor than any other “Wickless” Blue Flame Oil Stove.</p>

<div  class='figleft id013'>
<img src='images/image036c.jpg' alt='image of stove parts' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The burner cup is made of sheet metal, (brass) which is quickly heated,
so that in starting the stove, it can be put in operating in much less time than
is possible, where a heavy cast cup is used.</p>

<p class='c005'>That the burner cup is durable, is proven by the fact that in three years
experience with the sheet brass cup, we have never known of one burning out.</p>

<p class='c005'>The chimney, or combustion chamber of the “Standard” Wickless is a very
important feature, and one that is distinctly <i>our own</i>. To secure the greatest
efficiency from the burner, it is necessary that the flame be applied as near to the
<i>center</i> of the cooking vessel as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be seen from the cut of our chimney, that it is constructed with a
small tube in the center, which extends from below the burner to the top;
through this center tube, a current of fresh, warm air is constantly furnished
to the flames, which produces at the center of the burner, a most powerful
fire, applying it at a point where the greatest possible utilization of the heat
is secured.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through the large openings at the top of the inside perforate, a large proportion
of the flame is drawn toward the center of the burner, so that the heat is
applied evenly over the bottom of the cooking vessel, thereby securing the
greatest amount of benefit from the fuel consumed.</p>

<p>WRONG CONSTRUCTION.<br />No. 5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A comparative glance at the two cuts,
will show how the heat from our burner
spreads evenly over the bottom of the article
heated. If the top of the perforate were
closed, much of the heat would be lost by
being applied too far from the center of the
article to be heated.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>Reasons Why Preferred.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'><b>It has no wick</b></p>

<p class='c013'>and is easily kept clean.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It has no joints to leak</b></p>

<p class='c013'>or packing nuts. No pressure of oil below the tank. It cannot leak.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It does not generate or evaporate.</b></p>

<p class='c013'>The oil simply drops into an open brass pipe through which it is conducted to an open
burner ring where it burns, producing a powerful blue flame. Could anything be
simpler?</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It has a removable tank</b></p>

<p class='c013'>which can be carried to an outer room for filling.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It is absolutely safe.</b></p>

<p class='c014'><b>It lights quickly.</b></p>

<p class='c013'>Simply turn on the oil and apply the match.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It cooks instantly.</b></p>

<p class='c013'>There is no smoke—no delay. As soon as lighted a cooking vessel can be placed over
the burner.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It has no stops</b></p>

<p class='c013'>or automatic regulators to govern the flow of oil. The flame is entirely under the control
of the user.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It makes no difference</b></p>

<p class='c013'>what quality of oil is used, whether coal oil or gasoline, whether it is good or bad, heavy
or light, thick or thin, hot or cold, the stove operates equally well, producing an intensely
hot, smokeless blue flame. Can as much be said <span class='fss'>TRUTHFULLY</span> of any other stove?</p>

<p class='c014'><b>It has a glass sight feed</b></p>

<p class='c013'>which shows at a glance the flow of oil and enables the user to regulate the valve
quickly and accurately.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>For economy of fuel</b></p>

<p class='c013'>as compared with the coal and wood stove, it is beyond comparison. Will save what
it cost in one season over coal or wood at the average price. It is a friend and helper
to the thrifty housekeeper who tries to save what others waste.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Especially.</b></p>

<p class='c013'>It is a boon to the country home and suburban residence, where fuel gas cannot be obtained.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Lastly.</b></p>

<p class='c013'>It is safe, clean, quick, reliable and convenient, and no home can afford to forego the
comfort that this wonderful stove brings.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>The dealer</b></p>

<p class='c013'>who recognizes the merits of the “Standard” Wickless and places it on his sales floor
will find it a ready and popular seller.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is a stove without competition, having many valuable special features found in
no other stove. It has large top surface, with two powerful 3½ inch burners for cooking
purposes, and two 3½ inch burners on step, giving it a cooking and baking capacity sufficient
for a good sized family. Has removable tank and glass sight feed. What to do with
a portable oven when not in use is a problem which has puzzled many a systematic housekeeper.
We have solved it. Push the oven back, as shown in above cut. Our reflex oven,
which is large and convenient, has thorough ventilation and produces perfect results not
obtainable in the ordinary coal or wood stove oven. The No. 275 is a safe, simple, clean,
economical oil stove. We especially recommend this size.</p>

<p class='c007'>A complete family cook stove having five burners, which can be used for cooking,
singly or all at the same time. The burners are 3½ inches in diameter and give a powerful
blue flame. When used at their full capacity each burner is sufficient for heating two
or more cooking vessels. The two step burners are 3½ inches in diameter and can also be
used separately for cooking. Together, they give requisite heat for baking in our New

  <h2 id='wick' class='c003'>The “Standard” Wick Blue Flame.<br /><span class='large'>For Coal Oil.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>To those who prefer the Wick Blue Flame Stove we offer the “Standard” which has
already proven a complete success, doing its work perfectly and quickly, and with the utmost
economy and safety. Mounted on a new encased sheet steel frame and is handsome
in design and finish.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What It Does.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The “Standard” uses common coal oil (kerosene), and owing to the
scientific principle embodied in the burner, secures perfect combustion,
producing a powerful blue flame, absolutely smokeless, and with proper care is practically
odorless. It cooks and bakes perfectly. A cooking utensil or flat iron can be placed in
direct contact with the flame, thus securing full benefit of the heat generated; at the same
time not a particle of soot will be deposited upon the utensil. Thus the defects of the old
style, yellow flame oil stoves are overcome; there is no soot, no smoke, no offensive odor;
perfect combustion is secured and the work is done <i>better</i>, <i>more quickly</i> and at <i>less expense</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its Safety and Convenience.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The “New Process” Blue Flame Oil Stove is safer and easier to operate
than an ordinary coal oil lamp. There are no chimneys to break.
The oil tank being located below the top of the wick tube, there is no
danger of the oil running over and flooding the stove. The reservoir is away from the fire
and consequently is always cold. It is impossible to get the wick too high. The wick is
simply turned up to a stop and the light applied, insuring a perfect and steady blue flame
from start to finish. An automatic locking device on the dial <span class='fss'>PREVENTS</span> wick being turned
too high and producing smoke, or its being accidentally turned beyond control of the wick
raiser.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its Care.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The “New Process” Blue Flame Oil Stove is easy to understand and to take
care of. Complete instructions accompany each stove, and we urge that both
dealers and users familiarize themselves with these instructions before starting the stove in
operation. As a rule, <span class='fss'>THE MISTAKE IS MADE</span> of trimming the wicks too much, thus destroying
them needlessly. No portion of the wick should be removed except the free carbon
that collects on its upper edge. <span class='sc'>The charred portion of the wick proper should
not be disturbed or removed.</span> It serves its purpose as well in our burner as the white,
fresh portion of the wick. Never trim wick except when absolutely necessary. Do not
allow oil reservoir to become empty; always keep reservoir well filled. Follow carefully
directions accompanying each stove, and perfect operation will be assured.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Testing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
All stoves are carefully tested for leakages and imperfections before shipping.
The “Standard” Wick Blue Flame is clean, convenient, safe, effective,
economical and has shown itself to be one of the best and most perfect oil stoves on the
market.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In constructing this heater, especial attention has been given to its efficiency in operation.
It produces a pure white flame of great intensity and heating power.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Standard” is well proportioned and handsome in appearance.</p>

<p class='c005'>The upper drum is made of planished steel, and nicely ornamented. The base is made
of stamped sheet steel and aluminum finished. Though massive in appearance, is light in
weight and very rigid. The lower part of fount is stamped in one piece, thereby avoiding
all leaks. The wick holder and raising device are new, simple and desirable features.</p>

<p class='c005'>We recommend the “Standard” as being a first-class heater in every respect.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Standard” is 28 inches in height; diameter of upper drum, 9¼ inches; size of
base, 14 inches; shipping weight, 20 lbs.</p>

20-inch tin reflector and chimney complete. We furnish it in either brass or nickel-plated
finish. The reservoir holds enough oil for eight hours’ burning, and is provided with an
indicator showing at all times the amount of oil in reservoir. The reservoir never becomes
heated. The lamp is fitted with a duplex spreader plate and makes a handsome white flame.
It will brilliantly illuminate a room 35 feet square, at a cost of less than one cent per hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our Vapor Street Light, as shown above, is the only one made with a removable fixture.
The reservoir holds one quart of gasoline. The fluid flows through the down pipe,
passes through the atomizer tube, where it is vaporized, and burns at the “Tip” like coal
gas. The number of hours each light is required to burn can be regulated by the amount
of the fluid put into the reservoir. Our system of vapor street lighting is largely used. We
sell our lanterns, fixtures and burners complete for public or private use.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
